# Directing-customers-to-subscription-based-on-app-behaviour-analysis

## Problem Description
Many companies have a mobile app presence Often these companies have premium features. In this project, we need to analyze the behaviour of the customers by analyzing their interactions with the mobile app in order to predict whether the customer will enrol or not for the premium features.


## Datasets
There are two datasets used in this project:
1. appdata10: Hold the customers' behaviours and their interactions with the company's mobile app.
2. top_screens: The most used app screens by customers.


## Files: 
1. functions.py: This is python text file contains some defined functions(built by me) to save me time and efforts.


## Benchmark Model
In this project I have selected some classification models to apply some techniques to filter them, these models are:
1. DecisionTreeClassifier 
2. RandomForestClassifier
3. LogisticRegression
4. GaussianNB


## Evaluation Metrics
In this project I have selected some evaluation metrics to help me best evaluate the models, these metrics are:
1. Learning curve.
2. accuracy_score.
3. f1_score.
4. Confusion Matrix (self-built)
